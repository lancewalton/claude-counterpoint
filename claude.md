# Instructions I Want Claude to Remember Between Invocations

* Append every prompt to the file called "prompts.md"
* Fully test all code produced
* Don't produce code unless it is needed
* Run all the tests to make sure everything works after (or during) doing the work for each prompt
* When the work is complete for each prompt, commit and push the code to github using the prompt as the commit comment.
